Customer gets only one discount.
One customer calculated at a time.
employee Discount = .10
contractor Discount = .20
high Order Discount = .05
high Order Amount = 800
high Age Cutoff = 90
old Customer Discount = 0
sales Tax = .08


Input:

original Price
age
contractor? (yes/no)
employee? (yes/no)

Calculations:

if (contractor = "yes")
   discount = original Price * contractor Discount
else
   discount = original Price * employee Discount
else if (original Price > high Order Amount)
   discount = original Price * high Order Discount
else if (age > 90)
   tax = 0

subtotal = original Price - discount
tax = sales Tax * subtotal
final Price = tax + subtotal
