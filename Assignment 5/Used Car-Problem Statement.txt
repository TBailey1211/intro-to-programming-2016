Problem Statement: 

Assumptions:
Dealership sells only Ford, GM, and Dodge cars. 
Only cars will be evaluated.
One car at a time. 
ford Less Rate = .02
ford Over Rate = .05
ford Middle Rate = .03
GM Less Rate = .05
GM Over Rate = .10
GM Middle Rate = .07
dodge Less Rate = .01
dodge Over Rate = .03
dodge Middle Rate = .02
less Cut Off = 10,000
over Cut Off = 20,000
error Flag = 0


Input:
base Price
vehicle Make


Calculations:
if vehicle Make = "Ford" then
   if base Price < less Cut Off
   rate = ford Less Rate
else
   if base Price > over Cut Off
   rate = ford Over Rate
else
   rate = ford Middle Rate 


if vehicle Make = "GM" then
   if base Price < less Cut Off
   rate = GM Less Rate
else 
   if base Price > over Cut Off
   rate = GM Over Rate
else
   rate = GM Middle Rate


if vehicle Make = "Dodge" then
   if base Price < less Cut Off
   rate = dodge Less Rate
else
   if base Price > over Cut Off
   rate = dodge Over Rate
else
   rate = dodge Middle Rate 


mark Up = rate * base price 
sale Price = mark Up + base Price
   

Output:

base Price
vehicle Make
sale Price
