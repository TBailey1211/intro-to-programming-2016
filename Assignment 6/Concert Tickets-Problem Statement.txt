Problem Statement: 

Assumptions:
One customer at a time.
Customers can only purchase seats in one type of section.
orchestra Rate = 50
floor Rate = 40
lower Level Rate = 30
upper Level Rate = 10


Input:
ticketType (orchestra, floor, lower level, upper level)
ticketAmount


Calculations:
if ticket Type = "orchestra"
   orchestra Accum = orchestra Accum + ticket Amount
else if ticket Type = "floor"
   floor Accum = floor Accum + ticket Amount
else if ticket Type = "lower level"
   lower Level Accum = lower Level Accum + ticket Amount
else if ticket Type = "upper level"
   upper Level Accum = upper Level Accum + ticket Amount

money Orchestra = orchestra Accum * orchestra Rate
money Floor = floor Accum * floor Rate
money Lower Level = lower Level Accum * lower Level Rate
money Upper Level = upper Level Accum * upper Level Rate
total Money = money Orchestra + money Floor + money Lower Level + money Upper Level


Output: 
"Ask for $ orchestra rate"
"Ask for $ floor rate"
"Ask for $ lower level rate"
"Ask for $ upper level rate"
